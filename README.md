# HMEI-2021

This repository contains the data and analysis files for my internship with the High Meadows Environmental Institute during the summer of 2021, with Professor Denise Mauzerall's lab at Princeton University, under post-doctoral researcher Dr. Disha Sharma. 

The data files, which record levels of various air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NOx, SO2, and Ozone) from January 2015-August 2021, were downloaded from India's continuous air pollution monitoring networks (CAAQMS). 

Subsequent analyses were performed to analyze temporal and spatial change in air pollution during the COVID-19 lockdowns in Delhi in 2020 and 2021, using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
